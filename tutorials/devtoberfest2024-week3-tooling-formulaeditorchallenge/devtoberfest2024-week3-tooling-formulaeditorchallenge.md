### Question 1

Find the missing function that can convert "ICETEA" to 1C3734.

UPPERCASE(________("ICETEA"))






### Question 2

Consider an app variable called **sentence** that contains many words in it, separated by a space. Write the missing function in the formula below in order to display the output as a string with the words in reverse order and separated by a comma without spaces. 

JOIN(________(SPLIT(appVars.sentence, " ")), ",")

For example, if the sentence is "a very long sentence", the output should be "sentence,long,very,a".



### Question 3

Enter the function to complete the formula so that it fills the button background color with **#0070f2** if the number on the button is **Odd** and fills the button background color with **#E1F4FF** if the number is **even**.  

IF(________(repeated.current.id), "#0070f2", "#E1F4FF")

The formula should be generic enough to display the background color accordingly, irrespective of the position of the odd number. For example, in the following image, only the numbers 1 and 3 have the background color as **#0070f2** since they are the only odd numbers.
