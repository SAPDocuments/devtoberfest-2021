The way this works is you have to fill out this grid, but each clue is described in a separate step and you must enter the answer there. You can copy the grid and fill in the answers as you enter them in the steps of this tutorial.

If you are not familiar with cryptic crosswords, there are many sites that explain the brilliance that are cryptic crossword puzzles. Here's one: [Cryptic Crossword](http://www.sarahlolley.com/intro-to-cryptic-crosswords.html).

But in short, instead of each clue being just a definition, each clue has 2 parts (one at the start and one at the end). One part â€“ which can be at the start or the end â€“ is a definition, but the other part is clue to how to form the word. All clues indicate the number of letters in the answer.

For example, my favorite clue is something like this:

>Paâ€™s mixed up about cloud software company (3)

1. The first part describes the answer's letters. "mixed up" suggests an anagram of "Pa's".

2. The second part is the definition "cloud software company".

So the answer is, of course,  ... SAP ðŸ¥³ 

We have already filled in 2 answers for you: **SAP BTP** (the platform on which SAP Build is available) and **List** (a complex data type in SAP Build Apps and SAP Build Process Automation).
