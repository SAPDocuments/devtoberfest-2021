# ðŸŸ¡ Devtoberfest 2024 - Fun Friday Week 3 - Bugtoberfest JavaScript
<!-- description --> This is the JavaScript Bug Hunt!

## You will learn
- How to have fun hunting for bugs in code.

## Prerequisites
- Basic to intermediary knowledge of JavaScript.


## Intro
As a part of Devtoberfest 2024 Fun Friday events, we have a bug hunt written in multiple languages for you to complete! The questions will range from easy to spot to a little more difficult, requiring some knowledge of the individual languages to complete. Each question will have 1 to 10 bugs and no bug should require running the code for the bug to appear.

Remember to have fun and enjoy the bug hunt. Happy hunting!

This tutorial is part of the Devtoberfest 2024, a celebration of and for Developers. For more information, see the [Devtoberfest Group](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/gh-p/Devtoberfest).
