### Question 1


### Question 2


### Question 3



### Question 4





### Question 5

If I create an automation with the following:

- A data type called `Sales Order` with the following fields:
    - `orderNumber`
    - `orderAmount`
    - `orderDate`
    - `orderStatus`
- Input parameter for the automation called `OrderNumber`.
- Step 2 reads an Excel sheet and stores the records as type `Sales Order` in a variable called `orders`. 

Now, I have a **For Each** loop in Step 5 that iterates over the `orders` variable from Step 2, and then I build a condition inside the loop to check if the current item in the list has an order number that matches the automations input parameter (`OrderNumber`).

Each item in the loop is stored in `currentMember` (which would be of type `Sales Order`) and the index is stored in `index`.

Write a formula to test whether the current item's order number matches the input parameter.
