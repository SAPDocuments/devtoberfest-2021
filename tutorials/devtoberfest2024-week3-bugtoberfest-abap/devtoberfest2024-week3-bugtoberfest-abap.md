# ðŸŸ¡ Devtoberfest 2024 - Fun Friday Week 3 - Bugtoberfest ABAP
<!-- description --> This is the ABAP Bug Hunt!

## You will learn
- How to have fun hunting for bugs in code.

## Prerequisites
- Basic to intermediary knowledge of ABAP.


## Intro
As a part of Devtoberfest 2024 Fun Friday events, we have a bug hunt written in multiple languages for you to complete! The questions will range from easy to spot to a little more difficult, requiring some knowledge of the individual languages to complete. Each question will have 1 to 10 bugs and no bug should require running the code for the bug to appear.

Remember to have fun and enjoy the bug hunt. Happy hunting!

## Hints to count the bugs
If the same bugs are repeated in a single line then, it's counted as 1. 
Eg: Missing multiple braces () in the same statement is considered as 1

Every unique bug in the same line will be counted separately. 

This tutorial is part of the Devtoberfest 2024, a celebration of and for Developers. For more information, see the [Devtoberfest Group](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/gh-p/Devtoberfest).
