# ðŸŸ¡ Devtoberfest 2024 - Fun Friday Week 3 - Bugtoberfest Bash
<!-- description --> This is the Bash Bug Hunt!

## You will learn
- How to have fun hunting for bugs in code.

## Prerequisites
- Basic to intermediate knowledge of Bash.


## Intro
As a part of Devtoberfest 2024 Fun Friday events, we have a bug hunt written in multiple languages for you to complete! The questions will range from easy to spot to a little more difficult, requiring some knowledge of the individual languages to complete. Each question will have 1 to 10 bugs and no bug should require running the code for the bug to appear.

There may be occasions where, for example, a misspelled variable may occur multiple times. Count this as one bug as a whole, not one bug for each of the occurrences of the misspelling.

If you're curious to learn more about good Bash scripting habits, be sure to check out these resources:

* [progrium/bashstyle](https://gist.github.com/outro56/4a2403ae8fefdeb832a5)
* [Bash pitfalls](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls)
* [Shellcheck](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls)
* [Improving my shell scripting](https://qmacro.org/blog/posts/2020/10/05/improving-my-shell-scripting/)

Remember to have fun and enjoy the bug hunt. Happy hunting!

This tutorial is part of Devtoberfest 2024, a celebration of and for Developers. For more information, see the [Devtoberfest Group](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/gh-p/Devtoberfest).

### Question 1 (Easy)

Find the bugs in the following code.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

read -p 'Enter your name: '
$answer = $REPLY
echo 'Thank you. You entered $answer.'
```

<!--

Bugs (3 total)

- in the assignment of $REPLY to answer, answer should not be prefixed with $ (this is not Perl!)
- in the assignment, no spaces are allowed either before or after the equals symbol (=)
- inside single quotes, variables (`$answer` are not expanded (double quotes are needed here)

-->

### Question 2 (Medium)

Find the bugs in the following code. Assume that the `pass` tool referenced in this script exists (it's the [standard Unix password manager](https://www.passwordstore.org/)).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e
set pipefail

main {

  local account="${1:?No account specified}"

  # Cause script to abend if no account data stored
  pass "btp/$account" > dev/null

  cf login
    -a "$(pass "btp/$account/cfapiendpoint")" \
    -u "$(pass "btp/$account/user")" \
    -p "$(pass "btp/$account/password")"

  echo <<EOF
Thank you.
Logged in successfully.
EOF

}

main "$@"
```

<!--

Bugs (5 total)

- `pipefail` is an option that you need to set using the `-o` option of `set`
- functions can be declared with the `function` keyword like this: `function main { ... }` or without the `function` keyword (as here), but brackets are needed before the code block, like this: `main () { ... }`
- `dev/null` is relative, not absolute (i.e. there's no leading `/`) so this is not really what you want (to cleanly suppress STDOUT output it must be sent to `/dev/null`)
- the newline at the end of `cf login` is not escaped (with a `\`) so this `cf` command execution is not valid
- echo does not read from STDIN so we can't use a heredoc (<<); instead, cat could be used (or printf)

-->

### Question 3 (Hard)

In this (somewhat contrived but simple) script the bugs are less syntactical, and more subtle, and exhibit pitfalls described in the Bash Pitfalls resource referenced in the introduction to this tutorial.

The `shellcheck` tool will point out a number of pitfalls in this script, at various levels:

- Informational ("it's best not to do this")
- Warning ("this is not a good idea at all")
- Error ("this is broken")

Note that you should count _all_ types of levels, not just those at the Error level. This is mainly because in Bash, even Informational (arguably "best practice") are more important to be heeded than in other languages.

Good luck!

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

read -p 'Enter a color: ' color

if [ $color == 'black' ]; then
    echo "Black is not a color, it is the absence of color"
fi

if [ $color =~ ^(red|green|blue)$ ]; then
    echo "You chose a primary color"
fi

cd colors
touch "$color.txt"
```

> Bonus info: [the open square bracket is an executable](https://qmacro.org/blog/posts/2020/08/21/the-open-square-bracket-is-an-executable/)

<!--

Bugs (4 total)

- using `read` without `-r` will mangle backslashes (shellcheck Informational)
- it's usually a very bad idea to not quote your variables, especially in a `[` construct
- to use the regular expression operator `=~` you need the Bash-specific `[[ ... ]]` construct, and not the `[` command - see https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031
- not checking the success (or otherwise) of a `cd` command is dangerous, and could result in the script creating, changing or deleting files in a place you didn't expect!
